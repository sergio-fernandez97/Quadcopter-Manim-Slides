## Instructions

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review the changes

3. Write a clear, concise commit message following conventional commits style:
   - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - First line: short summary (50 chars or less)
   - If needed, add blank line then detailed description
4. Create the commit with co-author attribution
5. Push to the remote repository
